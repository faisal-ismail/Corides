**CoRides** is a revolutionary ride-sharing application that leverages **Google Gemini AI** as an active orchestration agent. Unlike traditional ride-sharing apps, CoRides allows users to negotiate rides through natural voice and text conversations, with AI intelligently matching riders with drivers based on multi-stop route proximity and negotiated prices.

## 🎯 Core Features Implementation

### AI-Assisted Booking Flow

1. **User Interaction**: User taps the Gemini FAB button
2. **Voice/Text Input**: User speaks or types their ride request
3. **Slot Filling**: Gemini AI extracts:
   - Origin location
   - Destination location
   - Departure time
   - Price preference
4. **Validation**: AI asks follow-up questions for missing information
5. **Confirmation**: Once complete, ride request is created in Firestore
6. **Matching**: Cloud Functions match riders with nearby drivers

### Multi-Stop Route Matching

- Drivers set origin, destination, and waypoints
- Algorithm checks if rider's route is within 2km of driver's polyline
- Results sorted by price and proximity
- Real-time updates as drivers accept/decline
